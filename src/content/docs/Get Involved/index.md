## Contributions Welcome!

The C3 language is still in its *development* phase, which means
functionality and specification are subject to change. That also means
that any contribution right now will have a big impact on the language.
So if you find the project interesting, hereâ€™s what you can do to help:

### ðŸ’¬ Discuss The Language
- Join us on [C3 Discord](https://discord.gg/qN76R87).

### ðŸ’¡ Suggest Improvements
- Found a bug? [File an issue for C3 compiler](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/issues/new)
- Spotted a typo or broken link? [File an issue for the website](https://github.com/c3lang/c3-web/issues/new)

### ðŸ’ª Contribute

Now the compiler is stable, what is needed now are the *non-essentials*, such as a docs generator, editor plugins, LSP etc.

- [A list of what's needed is on Github](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/issues/1456).
