Building a project is done by invoking the C3 compiler with the `build` or `run` command inside of the project structure. The compiler will search upwards in the file hierarchy until a `project.json` file is found.

You can also [customise the project build config](/build-your-project/project-config/).

## Compile Individual Files

By default the compiler will compile a stand-alone file as an executable binary, rather than as a static or dynamic library.

The resulting executable binary will be given the same name as whichever C3 file contains the `main` function.

```bash
c3c compile <file1> <file2> <file3>
```

Alternatively, libraries can be compiled via `c3c static-lib` or `c3c dynamic-lib` or by creating a project configured as such and built via `c3c build` and `c3c run` and so on.

## Run

When starting out, with C3 it's natural to use `compile-run` to try things out. For larger projects, the built-in build system is recommended instead. 

The `compile-run` command works the same as normal compilation (via `compile`, `build`, etc), but also immediately runs the resulting executable.

```bash
c3c compile-run <file1> <file2> <file3>
```

## Common additional parameters

Additional parameters:
- `--lib <path>` add a library to search.
- `--output <path>` override the output directory.
- `--path <path>` execute as if standing at `<path>`
    
## Init a new project

```bash
c3c init <project_name> [optional path]
```

Create a new project structure in the current directory.

Use the `--template` command option to select a template. The following are built in:

- `exe` - the default template, produces an executable.
- `static-lib` - template for producing a static library.
- `dynamic-lib` - template for producing a dynamic library.

It is also possible to give the path to a custom template.

Additional parameters:
- `--template <path>` indicate an alternative template to use.

For example, `c3c init hello_world` creates the following structure:

<FileTree>
- build/
- docs/
- lib/
- resources/
- scripts/
- src/
  - main.c3
- test/
- LICENSE
- project.json
- README.md
</FileTree>

Check the [project configuration docs](/build-your-project/project-config/) to learn more about configuring your project.

## Test
```bash
c3c test
```
Will run any tests in the project in the `"sources"` directory defined in your `project.json`. For example:
```json5
...
"sources": [ "src/**" ],
...
```

Tests are defined with a `@test` attribute. For example:

```c3
fn void test_fn() @test
{
    assert(true == true, "true is definitely true");
}
```


## Build

```bash
c3c build [target]
```

Build the project in the current path. It doesn't matter where in the project structure you are. 

The built-in templates define two targets: `debug` (which is the default) and `release`.

## Clean

```bash
c3c clean
```

## Build and Run

```bash
c3c run [target]
```

Build the target (if needed) and run the executable.

## Clean and Run

```bash
c3c clean-run [target]
```

Clean, build and run the target.

## Dist

```bash
c3c dist [target]
```

*Not properly added yet*

Clean, build and package the target for distribution.
Will also run the target if it is a executable.

## Docs


```bash
c3c docs [target]
```

*Not added yet* 

Rebuilds the documentation. 


## Bench

```bash
c3c bench [target]
```

Runs benchmarks on a target.
