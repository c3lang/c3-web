## Projects in C3
Projects are *optional*, but are a good way to manage compiling code when there
 are a lot of files and modules.
They also allow you to specify libraries to link, and define how your project should be built for specific targets.

### 💡 Creating a new project

The `c3c init` command will create a new directory containing your project structure.
It requires a name of the project, we will use `myc3project` in its place.

```bash
c3c init myc3project
```

You can also customize the path where the project will be created or specify a *template*. For more information check the [init command reference](/build-your-project/build-commands/#init-a-new-project).

### 📁 Project structure

If you check the directory that was created you might find it a bit confusing with a bunch of different directories, but worry not because if you expand them you will realise that most of them are actually empty!

<FileTree>
- build/
- docs/
- lib/
- resources/
- scripts/
- src/
  - main.c3
- test/
- LICENSE
- project.json
- README.md
</FileTree>

#### Directory Overview
| Directory       | Usage         |
|-----------------|---------------|
| `./build`       | Where your temporary files and build results will go. |
| `./docs`        | Code Documentation |
| `./lib`         | C3 libraries (with the .c3l suffix) |
| `./resources`   | Non-code resources like images, sound effects etc. |
| `./scripts`     | Scripts, including .c3 scripts that generate code at compile time. |
| `./src`         | Storing our code, by default contains `main.c3` with "Hello World". |
| `project.json`  | Record project information, similar to `package.json` in NodeJS. |
| `LICENSE`       | Project license. |
| `README.md`     | Help others understand and use your code. | 

### 🔧 Building the project

Assuming you have successfully initialized a project as seen above, we can now look at how to compile it.

#### 🏃 Build & run

C3 has a simple command to build & run our project.

```bash {4}
c3c run
> Program linked to executable 'build/myc3project'.
> Launching ./build/myc3project...
> Hello, World
```

You can also specify the target to build & run.
```bash
c3c run myc3project
```
#### 🔧 Build

If you only want to build the project, you can use the `build` command:

```bash 
c3c build
```

This command builds the project targets defined in our `project.json` file.

:::note
If you want to build a specific target, you can do so by specifying its name.
The default target is created with the name of the project, such as `myc3project`.

```bash 
c3c build myc3project
```
:::

We will now have a binary in `build`, which we can run:

```bash
./build/myc3project
```

It should print `Hello, World!` and return back to the command line prompt. 
If you are on Windows, you will have `myc3project.exe` instead. Call it in the same way.


If you need more detail later on check [C3 project build commands](/build-your-project/build-commands/) and [C3 project configuration](/build-your-project/project-config/) to learn more.
