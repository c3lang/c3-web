During compilation, constant expressions will automatically be folded. Together with the compile
time conditional statements `$if`, `$switch` and the compile time iteration statements `$for` `$foreach`
it is possible to perform limited compile time execution.

### Compile time values

During compilation, global constants are considered compile time values, as are any
derived constant values, such as type names and sizes, variable alignments etc.

Inside of a macro or a function, it is possible to define mutable compile time variables. Such
local variables are prefixed with `$` (e.g. `$foo`). It is also possible to define local *type* variables,
that are also prefixed using `$` (e.g. `$MyType` `$ParamType`).

Mutable compile time variables are *not* allowed in the global scope.

### Concatenation

The compile time concatenation operator `+++` can be used at compile
time to concatenate arrays and strings:

```c3
macro int[3] @foo(int $y)
{
    int[2] $z = { 1, 2 };
    return $z +++ $y;
}

fn void main()
{
	io::printn(@foo(4)); // prints "{ 1, 2, 4 }"
}
```

### Compile time && and ||

The operators `&&&` and `|||` perform compile time versions of `&&` and
`||`. The difference between the runtime operators is that the right hand side is not type
checked if the left hand side is `false` in the case of `&&&` and true in the case of `|||`.

This allows us to safely write this macro code:
```c3
// Compiles even if @foo doesn't exist
$if $defined(@foo()) &&& @foo():
  ...
$endif
```

If `@foo()` doesn't exist, then this still compiles. However, if we had used `&&` instead this would have been an error:
```c3
$if $defined(@foo()) && @foo(): // ERROR: '@foo' could not be found.
  ...
$endif
```

### `$if` and `$switch`

`$if <const expr>:` takes a compile time constant value and evaluates it to true or false.

```c3
macro @foo($x, #y)
{
    $if $x > 3:
        #y += $x * $x;
    $else
        #y += $x;
    $endif
}

const int FOO = 10;

fn void test()
{
    int a = 5;
    int b = 4;
    @foo(1, a); // Allowed, expands to a += 1;
    // @foo(b, a); // Error: b is not a compile time constant.
    @foo(FOO, a); // Allowed, expands to a += FOO * FOO;
}
```

For switching between multiple possibilities, use `$switch`.

```c3
macro @foo($x, #y)
{
    $switch $x:
        $case 1:
            #y += $x * $x;
        $case 2:
            #y += $x;
        $case 3:
            #y *= $x;
        $default:
            #y -= $x;
    $endswitch
}
```

Switching without argument is also allowed, which works like an if-else chain:

```c3
macro @foo($x, #y)
{
    $switch
        $case $x > 10:
            #y += $x * $x;
        $case $x < 0:
            #y += $x;
        $default:
            #y -= $x;
    $endswitch
}
```

### Loops using `$foreach` and `$for`

`$for` ... `$endfor` works analogous to `for`, only it is limited to using compile time variables. `$foreach` ... `$endforeach` similarly
matches the behaviour of `foreach`.

Compile time looping:

```c3
macro foo($a)
{
    $for var $x = 0; $x < $a; $x++:
        io::printfn("%d", $x);
    $endfor
}

fn void test()
{
    foo(2);
    // Expands to ->
    // io::printfn("%d", 0);
    // io::printfn("%d", 1);
}
```

Looping over enums:

```c3
macro foo_enum($SomeEnum)
{
    $foreach $x : $SomeEnum.values:
        io::printfn("%d", (int)$x);
    $endforeach
}

enum MyEnum
{
    A,
    B,
}

fn void test()
{
    foo_enum(MyEnum);
    // Expands to ->
    // io::printfn("%d", (int)MyEnum.A);
    // io::printfn("%d", (int)MyEnum.B);
}
```

:::note
The content of the `$foreach` or `$for` body must be at least a complete statement.
It's not possible to compile partial statements.

### Compile time macro execution

If a macro only takes compile time parameters, that is only `$`-prefixed parameters, and then does not generate
any other statements than returns, then the macro will be completely compile time executed.

```c3
macro @test($abc)
{
    return $abc * 2;
}

const int MY_CONST = @test(2); // Will fold to "4"
```

This constant evaluation allows us to write some limited compile time code. For example, this
macro will compute Fibonacci at compile time:

```c3
macro long @fib(long $n)
{
    $if $n <= 1:
        return $n;
    $else
        return @fib($n - 1) + @fib($n - 2);
    $endif
}
```

It is important to remember that if we had replaced `$n` with `n` the compiler would have complained. `n <= 1`
is not be considered to be a constant expression, even if the actual argument to the macro was a constant.
This limitation is deliberate, to offer control over what is compiled out and what isn't.

### Conditional compilation at the top level using `@if`

At the top level, conditional compilation is controlled using with `@if` attributes on declarations

```c3
fn void foo_win32() @if(env::WIN32)
{
    /* .... */
}

struct Foo
{
    int a;
    int b @if(env::NO_LIBC);
}
```

The argument to `@if` must be possible to resolve to a constant at compile time. This means that argument
may also be a compile time evaluated macro:

```c3
macro bool @foo($x) => $x > 2;

int x @if(@foo(5)); // Will be included
int y @if(@foo(0)); // Will not be included
```

#### Evaluation order of top level conditional compilation

Conditional compilation at the top level can cause unexpected ordering issues, especially when combined with
`$defined`. At a high level, there are three phases of evaluation:

1. Non-conditional declarations are registered.
2. Conditional module sections are either discarded or have all of their non-conditional declarations registered.
3. Each module in turn will evaluate `@if` attributes for each module section.

The order of module and module section evaluation in (2) and (3) is not deterministic and any use of `$defined` should not
rely on this ordering.

## Compile time introspection

At compile time, full type information is available. This allows for creation of reusable, code generating macros for things
like serialization.

```c3
usz foo_alignment = Foo.alignof;
usz foo_member_count = Foo.membersof.len;
String foo_name = Foo.nameof;
```

To read more about all the fields available at compile time, see the page on [reflection](/generic-programming/reflection).

## Compile time functions

A set of compile time functions are available at compile time:

### `$alignof`

Get the alignment of something.
See [reflection](/generic-programming/reflection/#alignof).

### `$assert`

Check a condition at compile time.

```c3
$assert($arg > 3);
```

### `$assignable`

Check if an expression is assignable to the given type, e.g. `Type x = expr;` would be valid.

```c3
fn void main()
{
    int x;
    $assert($assignable(x, long));
    $assert($assignable(3, char));      // Allowed even though the type of 3 is int
    $assert(!$assignable(x, void*));    // int -> void* not implicitly available
    $assert(!$assignable(x + x, long)); // Ambiguous widening
}
```

### `$defined`

Returns true if a type or identifier is defined.
See [reflection](/generic-programming/reflection/#defined).

### `$echo`

Print a message to stdout when compiling the code.

### `$embed`

Embed binary data from a file.
See [expressions](/language-fundamentals/expressions/#including-binary-data).

### `$error`

When this is compiled, issue a compile time error.

### `$eval`

Converts a compile time string to the corresponding variable or function.
See [reflection](/generic-programming/reflection/#eval).

```c3
fn void main()
{
    int x;
    var $s = "x";
    $eval($s) = 3;
    io::printn(x);  // Prints 3
}
```
