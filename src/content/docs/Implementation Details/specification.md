*THIS SPECIFICATION IS UNDER DEVELOPMENT*

## Notation

The syntax is specified using Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF):

```
production  ::= PRODUCTION_NAME '::=' expression?
expression  ::= alternative ("|" alternative)* 
alternative ::= term term*
term        ::= PRODUCTION_NAME | TOKEN | set | group | option | repetition
set         ::= '[' (range | CHAR) (rang | CHAR)* ']'
range       ::= CHAR '-' CHAR 
group       ::= '(' expression ')'
option      ::= expression '?'
repetition  ::= expression '*'
```

Productions are expressions constructed from terms and the following operators, in increasing precedence:

```
|   alternation
()  grouping
?  option (0 or 1 times)
*  repetition (0 to n times)
```

Uppercase production names are used to identify lexical tokens. Non-terminals are in lower case. Lexical tokens are
enclosed in single quotes ''.

The form `a..b` represents the set of characters from a through b as alternatives.

## Source code representation

A program consists of one or more _translation units_ stored in files written in the Unicode character set,
stored as a sequence of bytes using the UTF-8 encoding. Except for comments and the contents of character and string
literals, all input elements are formed only from the ASCII subset (U+0000 to U+007F) of Unicode.

A raw byte stream is translated into a sequence of tokens which white space and non-doc comments are discarded. Doc
comments may optionally be discarded as well. The resulting input elements form the tokens that are the terminal symbols
of the syntactic grammar.

### Lexical Translations

A raw byte stream is translated into a sequence of tokens which white space and non-doc comments are discarded. Doc
comments may optionally be discarded as well. The resulting input elements form the tokens that are the terminal symbols
of the syntactic grammar.

The longest possible translation is used at each step, even if the result does not ultimately make a correct program
while another lexical translation would.

> Example: `a--b` is translated as `a`, `--`, `b`, which does not form a grammatically correct expression, even though the tokenization `a`, `-`, `-`, `b` could form a grammatically correct expression.

### Line Terminators

The C3 compiler divides the sequence of input bytes into lines by recognizing *line terminators*

Lines are terminated by the ASCII LF character (U+000A), also known as "newline". A line termination specifies the
termination of the // form of a comment.

### Input Elements and Tokens

An input element may be:

1. White space
2. Comment
3. Doc Comment
4. Token

A token may be:

1. Identifier
2. Keyword
3. Literal
4. Separator
5. Operator

A Doc Comment consists of:

1. A stream of descriptive text
2. A list of directive Tokens

Those input elements that are not white space or comments are tokens. The tokens are the terminal symbols of the
syntactic grammar. Whitespace and comments can serve to separate tokens that might be tokenized in another manner. For
example the characters `+` and `=` may form the operator token `+=` only if there is no intervening white space or
comment.

### White Space

White space is defined as the ASCII horizontal tab character (U+0009), form feed character (U+000A), vertical tab (
U+000B), carriage return (U+000D), space character (U+0020) and the line terminator character (U+000D).

```
WHITESPACE      ::= [ \t\f\v\r\n]
```

### Letters and digits

```
UC_LETTER       ::= [A-Z]
LC_LETTER       ::= [a-z]
LETTER          ::= UC_LETTER | LC_LETTER
DIGIT           ::= [0-9]
HEX_DIGIT       ::= [0-9a-fA-F]
BINARY_DIGIT    ::= [01]
OCTAL_DIGIT     ::= [0-7]
LC_LETTER_US    ::= LC_LETTER | "_"
UC_LETTER_US    ::= UC_LETTER | "_"
ALPHANUM        ::= LETTER | DIGIT
ALPHANUM_US     ::= ALPHANUM | "_"
UC_ALPHANUM_US  ::= UC_LETTER_US | DIGIT
LC_ALPHANUM_US  ::= LC_LETTER_US | DIGIT
```

### Comments

There are three types of regular comments:

1. `// text` a line comment. The text between `//` and line end is ignored.
2. `/* text */` block comments. The text between `/*` and `*/` is ignored. It has nesting behaviour, so for every `/*`
   discovered between the first `/*` and the last `*/` a corresponding `*/` must be found.

### Doc comments

1. `<* text *>` doc block comment. The text between `<*` and `*>` is optionally parsed using the doc comment
   syntactic grammar. A compiler may choose to read `<* text *>` as a regular comment.

### Identifiers

Identifiers name program entities such as variables and types. An identifier is a sequence of one or more letters and
digits.
The first character in an identifier must be a letter or underscore.

C3 has three types of identifiers: const identifiers - containing only underscore and upper-case letters,
type identifiers - starting with an upper case letter followed by at least one underscore letter and regular
identifiers, starting with a lower case letter.

```
IDENTIFIER      ::=  "_"* LC_LETTER ALPHANUM_US*
CONST_IDENT     ::=  "_"* UC_LETTER UC_ALPHANUM_US*
TYPE_IDENT      ::=  "_"* UC_LETTER UC_ALPHANUM_US* LC_LETTER ALPHANUM_US*
CT_IDENT        ::=  "$" IDENTIFIER
CT_CONST_IDENT  ::=  "$" CONST_IDENT
CT_TYPE_IDENT   ::=  "$" TYPE_IDENT
AT_TYPE_IDENT   ::=  "@" TYPE_IDENT
PATH_SEGMENT    ::= "_"* LC_LETTER LC_ALPHANUM_US*
```

### Keywords

The following keywords are reserved and may not be used as identifiers:

```
asm         any         anyfault
assert      attribute   break
case        cast        catch
const       continue    default
defer       def         do
else        enum        extern
errtype     false       fn
generic     if          import

$and        $assert     $case       
$default    $echo       $else       
$error      $endfor     $endforeach 
$endif      $endswitch  $for        
$foreach    $if         $switch     
$typef      $vaarg      $vaconst
$vacount    $varef      $vatype             
                  
```

### Operators and punctuation

The following character sequences represent operators and punctuation.

```
&       @       ~       |       ^       :
,       /       $       .       ;       )
>       <       #       {       }       -
(       )       *       [       ]       %
>=      <=      +       +=      -=      !
?       ?:      &&      ??      &=      |=
^=      /=      ..      ==      ({      })
[<      >]      (<      >)      ++      --      
%=      !=      ||      ::      <<      >>      
!!      ...     <<=     >>=
```

### Integer literals

An integer literal is a sequence of digits representing an integer constant.
An optional prefix sets a non-decimal base: 0b or 0B for binary,
0o, or 0O for octal, and 0x or 0X for hexadecimal.
A single 0 is considered a decimal zero.
In hexadecimal literals, letters a through f and A through F represent values 10 through 15.

For readability, an underscore character _ may appear after a base prefix
or between successive digits; such underscores do not change the literal's value.

```
INTEGER         ::= DECIMAL_LIT | BINARY_LIT | OCTAL_LIT | HEX_LIT
DECIMAL_LIT     ::= '0' | [1-9] ('_'* DECIMAL_DIGITS)?
BINARY_LIT      ::= '0' [bB] '_'* BINARY_DIGITS
OCTAL_LIT       ::= '0' [oO] '_'* OCTAL_DIGITS
HEX_LIT         ::= '0' [xX] '_'* HEX_DIGITS

BINARY_DIGIT    ::= [01]
HEX_DIGIT       ::= [0-9a-fA-F]

DECIMAL_DIGITS  ::= DIGIT ('_'* DIGIT)*
BINARY_DIGITS   ::= BINARY_DIGIT ('_'* BINARY_DIGIT)*
OCTAL_DIGITS    ::= OCTAL_DIGIT ('_'* OCTAL_DIGIT)*
HEX_DIGITS      ::= HEX_DIGIT ('_'* HEX_DIGIT)*
```

```
42
4_2
0_600
0o600
0O600           // second character is capital letter 'O'
0xBadFace
0xBad_Face
0x_67_7a_2f_cc_40_c6
170141183460469231731687303715884105727
170_141183_460469_231731_687303_715884_105727

0600            // Invalid, non zero decimal number may not start with 0 
_42             // an identifier, not an integer literal
42_             // invalid: _ must separate successive digits
0_xBadFace      // invalid: _ must separate successive digits
```

### Floating point literals

A floating-point literal is a decimal or hexadecimal representation of a floating-point constant.

A decimal floating-point literal consists of an integer part (decimal digits), a decimal point,
a fractional part (decimal digits), and an exponent part (e or E followed by an optional
sign and decimal digits). One of the integer part or the fractional part may be elided;
one of the decimal point or the exponent part may be elided. An exponent value exp scales
the mantissa (integer and fractional part) by powers of 10.

A hexadecimal floating-point literal consists of a 0x or 0X prefix, an integer part
(hexadecimal digits), a radix point, a fractional part (hexadecimal digits),
and an exponent part (p or P followed by an optional sign and decimal digits).
One of the integer part or the fractional part may be elided; the radix point
may be elided as well, but the exponent part is required.
An exponent value exp scales the mantissa (integer and fractional part) by powers of 2.

For readability, an underscore character _ may appear after a base prefix or between successive digits;
such underscores do not change the literal value.

```
FLOAT_LIT       ::= DEC_FLOAT_LIT | HEX_FLOAT_LIT
DEC_FLOAT_LIT   ::= DECIMAL_DIGITS '.' DECIMAL_DIGITS? DEC_EXPONENT? 
                    | DECIMAL_DIGITS DEC_EXPONENT
                    | '.' DECIMAL_DIGITS DEC_EXPONENT?
DEC_EXPONENT    ::= [eE] [+-]? DECIMAL_DIGITS
HEX_FLOAT_LIT   ::= '0' [xX] HEX_MANTISSA HEX_EXPONENT
HEX_MANTISSA    ::= HEX_DIGITS '.' HEX_DIGITS?
                    | HEX_DIGITS
                    | '.' HEX_DIGITS 
HEX_EXPONENT    ::= [pP] [+-] DECIMAL_DIGITS                    
```

### Characters

Characters are the fundamental components of strings and character literals.

```
CHAR_ELEMENT    ::= [\x20-\x26] | [\x28-\x5B] | [\x5D-\x7F]
CHAR_LIT_BYTE   ::= CHAR_ELEMENT | \x5C CHAR_ESCAPE
CHAR_ESCAPE     ::= [abefnrtv\'\"\\] 
                    | 'x' HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT
UNICODE_CHAR    ::= unicode_char                    
                    | 'u' HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT
                    | 'U' HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT 
                          HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT HEX_DIGIT
```

### Backslash escapes

The following backslash escapes are available for characters and string literals:

```text
\0      0x00 zero value
\a      0x07 alert/bell
\b      0x08 backspace
\e      0x1B escape
\f      0x0C form feed
\n      0x0A newline
\r      0x0D carriage return
\t      0x09 horizontal tab
\v      0x0B vertical tab
\\      0x5C backslash
\'      0x27 single quote '
\"      0x22 double quote "
\x      Escapes a single byte hex value
\u      Escapes a two byte unicode hex value 
\U      Escapes a four byte unicode hex value
```

### String literals

A string literal represents a string constant obtained from concatenating a sequence of characters.
String literals are character sequences between double quotes, as in "bar". Within the quotes,
any character may appear except newline and unescaped double quote. The text between the
quotes forms the value of the literal, with backslash escapes interpreted as they are in
rune literals, with the same restrictions. The two-digit hexadecimal (\xnn) escapes represent
individual bytes of the resulting string; all other escapes represent the (possibly multibyte)
UTF-8 encoding of individual characters. Thus inside a string literal `\xFF` represent a single
byte of value `0xFF` = 255, while `ÿ`, `\u00FF`, `\U000000FF` and `\xc3\xbf` represent the two bytes
`0xc3 0xbf` of the UTF-8 encoding of character `U+00FF`.

```
STRING_LIT      ::= \x22 (CHAR_LIT_BYTE | UNICODE_CHAR)* \x22
```

#### Compile time string concatenation

Strings will concatenate if declared in sequence.

Example:

```c
String s = "abc" "def" "ghi";
// This is equivalent to:
String s = "abcdefghi";
```

### Raw string literals

Raw string literals are enclosed between \`\` and consist of the raw UTF8 in the source
code between the "\`". A sequence of two "\`" will be interpreted as a single escaped "\`" that does
not terminate the literal.

#### Compile time concatenation

Raw strings will concatenate with other regular strings and raw strings (
see [string literal compile time concatenation](#compile-time-string-concatenation)).

#### Source code pre-filtering

The source code will pre-filter `\r` (`0x0D`) from the source code. This means that it is also implicitly
filtered out of raw strings.

### Character literals

A character literal is enclosed in `'` and may either consist of 1, 2, 4, 8, 16 bytes.

```
CHARACTER_LIT   ::= "'" (CHAR_LIT_BYTE+) | UNICODE_CHAR "'"
```

## Types

Types consist of built-in types and user-defined types (enums, structs, unions, bitstructs, fault and distinct).

### Boolean types

`bool` may have the two values `true` and `false`. It holds a single bit of information but is
stored in a `char` type.

### Integer types

The built-in integer types:

```text
char      unsigned 8-bit
ichar     signed 8-bit
ushort    unsigned 16-bit
short     signed 16-bit
uint      unsigned 32-bit
int       signed 32-bit
ulong     unsigned 64-bit
long      signed 64-bit
uint128   unsigned 128-bit
int128    singed 128-bit
```

In addition, the following type aliases exist:

```text
uptr      unsigned pointer size
iptr      signed pointer size
usz       unsigned pointer offset / object size
isz       signed pointer offset  / object size
```

### Floating point types

Built-in floating point types:

```
float16   IEEE 16-bit*
bfloat16  Brainfloat*
float     IEEE 32-bit
double    IEEE 64-bit
float128  IEEE 128-bit*
```

(* optionally supported)

### Vector types

A vector lowers to the platform's vector types where available. A vector has a base type and a width.

```
vector_type        ::= type "[<" length ">]"
```

#### Vector base type

The base type of a vector must be boolean, an integer or a floating point type.

#### Min width

The vector width must be at least 1.

#### Element access

Vector elements are accessed using `[]`. It is possible to take the address of a single element.

#### Alignment

Alignment of vectors are platform dependent, but is at least the alignment of its element type.

#### Vector operations

Vectors support the same arithmetics as its underlying type, and will perform the operation
element-wise.

Example:

```c
int[<2>] a = { 1, 3 };
int[<2>] b = { 2, 7 };

int[<2>] c = a * b;
// Equivalent to
int[<2>] c = { a[0] * b[0], a[1] * b[1] };
```

### Array types

An array has the alignment of its elements. An array must have at least one element.

### Slice types

The slice consist of a pointer, followed by an usz length, having the alignment of pointers.

### Pointer types

A pointer is the address to memory.

```text
pointer_type       ::= type "*"
```

#### Pointee type

The type of the memory pointed to is the **pointee type**. It may be any runtime type.

#### iptr and uptr

A pointer may be losslessly cast to an `iptr` or `uptr`. An `iptr` or `uptr` may be cast to a pointer of any type.

#### The wildcard pointer void*

The `void*` may implicitly cast into any other pointer type. The `void*`
[implicitly casts into any other pointer.

A void* pointer may never be dereferenced.

#### Pointer arithmetic on void*

Performing pointer arithmetics on void* will assume that the element size is 1. This includes
pointer arithmetics using subscripting.

#### Subscripting

Subscripting a pointer is equal to performing pointer arithmetics using the index, followed by a deref.
Subscripts on pointers may be negative and will never do bounds checks.

#### Deref

Dereferencing a pointer will return the value in the memory location interpreted as the **pointee type**.

####

### Struct types

A struct may not have zero members.

#### Alignment

A non-packed struct has the alignment of the member that has the highest alignment. A packed struct
has alignment 1. See [align attribute](#attributes) for details on changing the alignment.

### Union types

A union may not have zero members.

#### Alignment

A union has the alignment of the member that has the highest alignment. See [align attribute](#attributes) for
details on changing the alignment.

### Fault types

A fault is an extensible enum which can be used to create an Excuse for an empty [optional](/language-common/optionals-essential/#what-is-an-optional).

#### Alignment

A fault type has the same alignment as a pointer. See [align attribute](#attributes) for details on changing the
alignment.

### Enum types

### Function types

### Typeid type

The typeid is a pointer sized value which uniquely identifies a type.

### Any type

The `any` is a fat pointer (2 pointers wide) holding a pointer to a value and its corresponding [typeid](#typeid-type).
It cannot be dereferenced.

#### Fields

`.ptr` returns a `void*` pointer to the underlying value `.type` returns the [typeid](#typeid-type)
of the underlying value.

#### Switching over `any`

Switching over an `any` value creates an [any switch](#any-switch).

### Anyfault type

## Declarations and scope

## Expressions

### Assignment expression

```
assignment_expr    ::= ct_type_assign | unary_expr assignment_op expr
ct_type_assign     ::= ct_type_ident "=" type
assignment_op      ::= "=" | "+=" | "-=" | "*=" | "/=" | "%=" | "<<=" | ">>=" | "&=" | "^=" | "|="
```

#### Type assign

This assigns a new type to a compile time type variable. The value of the expression is the type assigned.

#### Combined assign

All assignment operations except for "=" are combined assign operation. They first perform the operation indicated
by the leftmost character(s) in the operator (e.g `+` for `+=`, `<<` for `<<=` etc) with the lhs and the rhs.
The result is then assigned to the left hand side. The result of the operation is the new value of the left
hand side.

#### Implicit conversion

If the left hand side is a pointer and the operation is "+=" or "-=" an attempt to implicitly convert to
isz/usz will be tried.

For all other types and operations, **an implicit conversion** of rhs to the type of lhs will be tried.

### Ternary, elvis and or-else expressions

```
ternary_group_expr ::= suffix_group_expr | ternary_expr | elvis_expr | orelse_expr
ternary_expr       ::= or_expr "?" expr ":" ternary_group_expr
elvis_expr         ::= suffix_expr "?:" ternary_group_expr
orelse_expr        ::= suffix_expr "??" ternary_group_expr
```

#### Ternary evaluation

The most left-hand expression is evaluated to a boolean. If it is true, the value of the middle
expression is returned, otherwise the last expression is returned.

Only the most left-hand expression and the returned expressions are evaluated.

The middle and last expression are implicitly converted to their **unified type**.

The resulting type is the **unified type**.

#### Elvis evaluation

Lhs and rhs are implicitly converted to their **unified type**.

The lhs is evaluated, it is then converted to a boolean, if the result it true, return the lhs value
before its boolean conversion. Otherwise return the right hand side.

The right hand side is only evaluated if the lhs evaluates to false.

The resulting type is the **unified type**.

#### Orelse evaluation

The lhs must be optional. The non-optional type for lhs and rhs are calculated.
The **unified type** of the result is calculated. Lhs are converted to the unified type
preserving their optionality.

At runtime, lhs is evaluated. If it evaluates to an optional, rhs is returned instead.

Rhs is only evaluated if lhs evaluates to an optional.

The resulting type of the orelse is the post conversion type of the rhs.

### Suffix expression

Suffix expressions convert a fault to an optional.

```
suffix_group_exp   ::= or_group_expr | suffix_expr
suffix_expr        ::= or_group_expr "?" "!"?
```

#### Effect of "?"

The "?" will convert the expression into an optional. The left hand side must be a fault type.
If an optional "!" follows, this optional is immediately returned, as if by a `return <expr>?` statement.

#### Type of the expression

The type is a **wildcard optional**. If "!" is added, it is a **wildcard** type.

### Rethrow expression

If the expression is optional, implicitly return with the optional value.

```
rethrow_expr       ::= expr "!"
```

#### The expression to rethrow

The expression must have an optional type, otherwise this is a compile time error.

#### Type

The type of "rethrow" is the inner expr type without optional.

### Relational expression

```
rel_group_expr     ::= add_group_expr | relational_expr
relational_expr    ::= rel_group_expr relational_op add_group_expr
relational_op      ::= "<" | ">" | "<=" | ">=" 
```

TODO

### And expression

This binary expression evaluates the lhs, and if the result is `true` evaluates the rhs. The
result is true if both lhs and rhs are true.

```
and_group_expr     ::= rel_group_expr | and_expr
and_expr           ::= and_group_expr "&&" rel_group_expr
```

#### Type

The type of the and-expression is `bool`.

### Or expression

This binary expression evaluates the lhs, and if the result is `false` evaluates the rhs. The
result is true if lhs or rhs is true.

```
or_group_expr      ::= and_group_expr | or_expr
or_expr            ::= or_group_expr "||" and_group_expr
```

#### Constant folded arithmetics

Constant folding will happen for constant integers and floating. Vectors operations will
not be constant-folded.

Constant folded operations are: multiplication, division, addition, subtraction,
bit shifts, bit negation, bitwise and, or and xor, comparison, logical and/or,
and negation.

#### Type

The type of the or-expression is `bool`.

### Casts

### Pointer casts

#### Integer to pointer cast

Any integer of pointer size or larger may be explicitly cast to a pointer. An integer to pointer cast is considered
non-constant, except in the special case where the integer == 0. In that case, the result is constant `null`.

Example:

```
byte a = 1;
int* b = (int*)a; // Invalid, pointer type is > 8 bits.
int* c = (int*)1; // Valid, but runtime value.
int* d = (int*)0; // Valid and constant value.
```

#### Pointer to integer cast

A pointer may be cast to any integer, truncating the pointer value if the size of the pointer is larger than the pointer
size. A pointer to integer cast is considered non-constant, except in the special case of a null pointer, where it is
equal to the integer value 0.

Example:

```
fn void test() { ... }
def VoidFunc = fn void test();

VoidFunc a = &test;
int b = (int)null;
int c = (int)a; // Invalid, not constant
int d = (int)((int*)1); // Invalid, not constant
```

### Subscript operator

The subscript operator may take as its left side a pointer, array or slice. The index may be of any integer
type. TODO
*NOTE* The subscript operator is not symmetrical as in C. For example in C3 `array[n] = 33` is allowed, but
not `n[array] = 33`. This is a change from C.

### Operands

### Compound Literals

Compound literals have the format

```
compound_literal   ::= TYPE_IDENTIFIER '(' initializer_list ')'
initializer_list   ::= '{' (initializer_param (',' initializer_param)* ','?)? '}'
initializer_param  ::= expression | designator '=' expression
designator         ::= array_designator | range_designator | field_designator
array_designator   ::= '[' expression ']'
range_designator   ::= '[' range_expression ']'
field_designator   ::= IDENTIFIER
range_expression   ::= (range_index)? '..' (range_index)?
range_index        ::= expression | '^' expression
```

Taking the address of a compound literal will yield a pointer to stack allocated temporary.

### Function calls

#### Function argument resolution

Call slots are in order: regular slots, vaarg slot, name-only slots.

No regular slots may appear after the vaarg slot, however there may be named parameters with default values 
after the vaarg slot if it's not a raw vaarg.

These "name-only" slots need to have a parameter name and a default value, and may only be called as named 
arguments.

Named arguments may never be *splat* expressions.

1. Step through all the arguments, resolve the named arguments and determine if there are any regular arguments.
2. If there are regular arguments, then named arguments may only be in name-only slots, otherwise it is an error.
3. If there are named arguments in the regular slots, all slots not provided arguments must have default values.
4. Proceed with evaluation of arguments from left to right in call invocation order.
6. Regular arguments are placed in the regular slots from left to right.
7. If a regular argument is a *splat* expression, evaluate it *without inference* and determine if it is an array, vector, untyped list or slice with a known size, otherwise it is an error.
8. A regular argument *splat* will be expanded into as many slots as its length, this may expand into vaarg arguments.
9. In the vaarg slot, *splatting* a slice will *forward* it.
10. In the vaarg slot, *splatting* an array, vector or untyped list will expand its elements as if they were provided as arguments.
11. A named argument may never appear more than once.
12. The vaarg slot may never be accessed using named arguments.

#### Varargs

For varargs, a `bool` or *any integer* smaller than what the C ABI specifies for the c `int` type is cast to `int`. Any
float smaller than a double is cast to `double`. Compile time floats will be cast to double. Compile time integers will
be cast to c `int` type.

## Statements

```
stmt               ::= compound_stmt | non_compound_stmt
non_compound_stmt  ::= assert_stmt | if_stmt | while_stmt | do_stmt | foreach_stmt | foreach_r_stmt 
                       | for_stmt | return_stmt | break_stmt | continue_stmt | var_stmt 
                       | declaration_stmt | defer_stmt | nextcase_stmt | asm_block_stmt
                       | ct_echo_stmt | ct_error_stmt | ct_assert_stmt | ct_if_stmt | ct_switch_stmt 
                       | ct_for_stmt | ct_foreach_stmt | expr_stmt 
```

### Asm block statement

An asm block is either a string expression or a brace enclosed list of asm statements.

```
asm_block_stmt      ::= "asm" ("(" constant_expr ")" | "{" asm_stmt* "}")
asm_stmt            ::= asm_instr asm_exprs? ";"
asm_instr           ::= ("int" | IDENTIFIER) ("." IDENTIFIER)
asm_expr            ::= CT_IDENT | CT_CONST_IDENT | "&"? IDENTIFIER | CONST_IDENT | FLOAT_LITERAL
                        | INTEGER | "(" expr ")" | "[" asm_addr "]"
asm_addr            ::= asm_expr (additive_op asm_expr asm_addr_trail?)?
asm_addr_trail      ::= "*" INTEGER (additive_op INTEGER)? | (shift_op | additive_op) INTEGER                         
```

TODO

### Assert statement

The assert statement will evaluate the expression and call the panic function if it evaluates
to false.

```
assert_stmt        ::= "assert" "(" expr ("," assert_message)? ")" ";"
assert_message     ::= constant_expr ("," expr)*
```

#### Conditional inclusion

`assert` statements are only included in "safe" builds. They may turn into **assume directives** for
the compiler on "fast" builds.

#### Assert message

The assert message is optional. It can be followed by an arbitrary number of expressions, in which case
the message is understood to be a format string, and the following arguments are passed as values to the
format function.

The assert message must be a compile time constant. There are no restriction on the format argument expressions.

#### Panic function

If the assert message has no format arguments or no assert message is included,
then the regular panic function is called. If it has format arguments then `panicf` is called instead.

In the case the `panicf` function does not exist (for example, compiling without the standard library),
then the format and the format arguments will be ignored and the `assert` will be treated
as if no assert message was available.

### Break statement

A break statement exits a `while`, `for`, `do`, `foreach` or `switch` scope. A labelled break
may also exit a labelled `if`.

```
break_stmt         ::= "break" label? ";"
```

#### Break labels

If a break has a label, then it will instead exit an outer scope with the label.

#### Unreachable code

Any statement following break in the same scope is considered unreachable.

### Compile time echo statement

During parsing, the compiler will output the text in the statement when it is semantically checked.
The statement will be turned into a NOP statement after checking.

```
ct_echo_stmt       ::= "$echo" constant_expr ";"
```

#### The message

The message must be a compile time constant string.

### Compile time assert statement

During parsing, the compiler will check the compile time expression
and create a compile time error with the optional message. After
evaluation, the `$assert` becomes a **NOP** statement.

```
ct_assert_stmt     ::= "$assert" constant_expr (":" constant_expr) ";"
```

#### Evaluated expression

The checked expression must evaluate to a boolean compile time constant.

#### Error message

The second parameter, which is optional, must evaluate to a constant string.

### Compile time error statement

During parsing, when semantically checked this statement will output
a compile time error with the message given.

```
ct_error_stmt      ::= "$error" constant_expr ";"
```

#### Error message

The parameter must evaluate to a constant string.

### Compile time if statement

If the cond expression is true, the then-branch is processed by the compiler. If it
evaluates to false, the else-branch is processed if it exists.

```
ct_if_stmt         ::= "$if" constant_expr ":" stmt* ("$else" stmt*)? "$endif"
```

#### Cond expression

The cond expression must be possible to evaluate to true or false at compile time.

#### Scopes

The "then" and "else" branches will add a compile time scope that is exited when reaching `$endif`.
It adds no runtime scope.

#### Evaluation

Statements in the branch not picked will not be semantically checked.

### Compile time switch statement

```
ct_switch_stmt     ::= "$switch" ("(" ct_expr_or_type ")")? ct_case_stmt+ "$endswitch"
ct_case_stmt       ::= ("$default" | "$case" ct_expr_or_type) ":" stmt* 
```

#### No cond expression switch

If the cond expression is missing, evaluation will go through each case until one case expression
evaluates to true.

#### Type expressions

If a cond expression is a type, then all case statement expressions must be types as well.

#### Ranged cases

Compile time switch does not support ranged cases.

#### Fallthrough

If a case clause has no statements, then when executing the case, rather than exiting the switch,
the next case clause immediately following it will be used. If that one should also be missing statements,
the procedure will be repeated until a case clause with statements is encountered,
or the end of the switch is reached.

#### Break and nextcase

Compile time switches do not support `break` nor `nextcase`.

#### Evaluation of statements

Only the case which is first matched has its statements processed by the compiler. All other statements
are ignored and will not be semantically checked.

### Continue statement

A continue statement jumps to the cond expression of a `while`, `for`, `do` or `foreach`

```
continue_stmt      ::= "continue" label? ";"
```

#### Continue labels

If a `continue` has a label, then it will jump to the cond of the while/for/do in the outer scope
with the corresponding label.

#### Unreachable code

Any statement following `continue` in the same scope is considered unreachable.

### Declaration statement

A declaration statement adds a new runtime or compile time variable to the current scope. It is available after the
declaration statement.

```
declaration_stmt   ::= const_declaration | local_decl_storage? optional_type decls_after_type ";"
local_decl_storage ::= "tlocal" | "static"
decls_after_type   ::= local_decl_after_type ("," local_decl_after_type)*
decl_after_type    ::= CT_IDENT ("=" constant_expr)? | IDENTIFIER opt_attributes ("=" expr)?
```

#### Thread local storage

Using `tlocal` allocates the runtime variable as a **thread local** variable. In effect this is the same as declaring
the variable as a global `tlocal` variable, but the visibility is limited to the function. `tlocal` may not be
combined with `static`.

The initializer for a `tlocal` variable must be a valid global init expression.

#### Static storage

Using `static` allocates the runtime variable as a function **global** variable. In effect this is the same as declaring
a global, but visibility is limited to the function. `static` may not be combined with `tlocal`.

The initializer for a `static` variable must be a valid global init expression.

#### Scopes

Runtime variables are added to the runtime scope, compile time variables to the compile time scope. See **var statements
**.

#### Multiple declarations

If more than one variable is declared, no init expressions are allowed for any of the variables.

#### No init expression

If no init expression is provided, the variable is **zero initialized**.

#### Opt-out of zero initialization

Using the @noinit attribute opts out of **zero initialization**.

#### Self referencing initialization

An init expression may refer to the **address** of the same variable that is declared, but not the **value** of the
variable.

Example:

```c
void* a = &a;  // Valid
int a = a + 1; // Invalid
```

### Defer statement

The defer statements are executed at (runtime) scope exit, whether through `return`, `break`, `continue` or rethrow.

```
defer_stmt         ::= "defer" ("try" | "catch")? stmt
```

#### Defer in defer

The defer body (statement) may not be a defer statement. However, if the body is a compound statement then
this may have any number of defer statements.

#### Static and tlocal variables in defer

Static and tlocal variables are allowed in a defer statement. Only a single variable is instantiated regardless of
the number of inlining locations.

#### Defer and return

If the `return` has an expression, then it is evaluated before the defer statements (due to exit from the current
function scope),
are executed.

Example:

```c
int a = 0;
defer a++;
return a;
// This is equivalent to
int a = 0;
int temp = a;
a++;
return temp;
```

#### Defer and jump statements

A defer body may not contain a `break`, `continue`, `return` or rethrow that would exit the statement.

#### Defer execution

Defer statements are executed in the reverse order of their declaration, starting from the last declared
defer statement.

#### Defer try

A `defer try` type of defer will only execute if the scope is left through normal fallthrough, `break`,
`continue` or a `return` with a result.

It will not execute if the exit is through a rethrow or a `return` with an optional value.

#### Defer catch

A `defer catch` type of defer will only execute if the scope is left through a rethrow or a `return` with an optional
value

It will not execute if the exit is a normal fallthrough, `break`, `continue` or a `return` with a result.

#### Non-regular returns - longjmp, panic and other errors

Defers will not execute when doing `longjmp` terminating through a `panic` or other error. They
are only invoked on regular scope exits.

### Expr statement

An expression statement evaluates an expression.

```
expr_stmt          ::= expr ";"
```

#### No discard

If the expression is a function or macro call either returning an optional *or* annotated `@nodiscard`, then
the expression is a compile time error. A function or macro returning an optional can use the `@maydiscard`
attribute to suppress this error.

### If statement

An if statement will evaluate the cond expression, then execute the first statement (the "then clause") in the if-body
if it evaluates to "true", otherwise execute the else clause. If no else clause exists, then the
next statement is executed.

```
if_stmt            ::= "if" (label ":")? "(" cond_expr ")" if_body
if_body            ::= non_compound_stmt | compound_stmt else_clause? | "{" switch_body "}"
else_clause        ::= "else" (if_stmt | compound_stmt)

```

#### Scopes

Both the "then" clause and the else clause open new scopes, even if they are non-compound statements.
The cond expression scope is valid until the exit of the entire statement, so any declarations in the
cond expression are available both in then and else clauses. Declarations in the "then" clause is not available
in the else clause and vice versa.

#### Special parsing of the "then" clause

If the then-clause isn't a compound statement, then it must follow on the same row as the cond expression.
It may not appear on a consecutive row.

#### Break

It is possible to use labelled break to break out of an if statement. Note that an unlabelled `break` may not
be used.

#### If-try

The cond expression may be a try-unwrap chain. In this case, the unwrapped variables are
scoped to the "then" clause only.

#### If-catch

The cond expression may be a catch-unwrap. The unwrap is scoped to the "then" clause only.
If one or more variables are in the catch, then the "else" clause have these variables
implicitly unwrapped.

Example:

```
int! a = foo();
int! b = foo();
if (catch a, b)
{
    // Do something
}
else
{
    int x = a + b; // Valid, a and b are implicitly unwrapped.
}  
```

#### If-catch implicit unwrap

If an if-catch's "then"-clause will jump out of the outer scope in all code paths and
the catch is on one or more variables, then this variable(s) will be implicitly unwrapped in the outer scope
after the if-statement.

Example:

```
int! a = foo();
if (catch a)
{
  return;
}  
int x = a; // Valid, a is implicitly unwrapped.
```

### Nextcase statement

Nextcase will jump to another `switch` case.

```
nextcase_stmt      ::= "nextcase" ((label ":")? (expr | "default"))? ";" 
```

#### Labels

When a nextcase has a label, the jump is to the switch in an outer scope with the corresponding label.

#### No expression jumps

A `nextcase` without any expression jumps to the next case clause in the current switch. It is not possible
to use no expression `nextcase` with labels.

#### Jumps to default

Using `default` jumps to the default clause of a switch.

#### Missing case

If the switch has constant case values, and the nextcase expression is constant, then the value of
the expression must match a case clause. Not matching a case is a compile time error.

If one or more cases are non-constant and/or the nextcase expression is non-constant, then no compile time check is
made.

#### Variable expression

If the nextcase has a non-constant expression, or the cases are not all constant, then first the nextcase expression
is evaluated. Next, execution will proceed *as if* the switch was invoked again, but with the nextcase expression as the
switch cond expression. See **switch statement**.

If the switch does not have a cond expression, nextcase with an expression is not allowed.

#### Unreachable code

Any statement in the same scope after a `nextcase` are considered **unreachable**.

### Switch statement

```
switch_stmt        ::= "switch" (label ":")? ("(" cond_expr ")")? switch body
switch_body        ::= "{" case_clause* "}"
case_clause        ::= default_stmt | case_stmt
default_stmt       ::= "default" ":" stmt*
case_stmt          ::= "case" label? expr (".." expr)? ":" stmt*
```

#### Regular switch

If the cond expression exists and all case statements have constant expression, then first the
cond expression is evaluated, next the case corresponding to the expression's value will be jumped to
and the statement will be executed. After reaching the end of the statements and a new case clause *or* the
end of the switch body, the execution will jump to the first statement after the switch.

#### If-switch

If the cond expression is missing or the case statements are non-constant expressions, then each case clause will
be evaluated in order after the cond expression has been evaluated (if it exists):

1. If a cond expression exists, calculate the case expression and execute the case if it is matching the
   cond expression. A default statement has no expression and will always be considered matching the cond expression
   reached.
2. If no con expression exists, calculate the case expression and execute the case if the expression evaluates to
   "true" when implicitly converted to boolean. A default statement will always be considered having the "true" result.

#### Any-switch

If the cond expression is an `any` type, the switch is handled as if switching was done over the `type`
field of the `any`. This field has the type of [typeid](#typeid-type), and the cases follows the rules
for [switching over typeid](#switching-over-typeid).

If the cond expression is a variable, then this variable is implicitly converted to a pointer with
the pointee type given by the case statement.

Example:

```c
any a = abc();
switch (a)
{
    case int:
        int b = *a;   // a is int*
    case float:
        float z = *a; // a is float*
    case Bar:
        Bar f = *a;   // a is Bar*
    default:
        // a is not unwrapped
}              
```

#### Ranged cases

Cases may be ranged. The start and end of the range must both be constant integer values. The start must
be less or equal to the end value. Using non-integers or non-constant values is a compile time error.

#### Fallthrough

If a case clause has no statements, then when executing the case, rather than exiting the switch, the next case clause
immediately following it will be executed. If that one should also be missing statement, the procedure
will be repeated until a case clause with statements is encountered (and executed), or the end of the switch is reached.

#### Exhaustive switch

If a switch case has a default clause *or* it is switching over an enum and there exists a case for each enum value
then the switch is exhaustive.

#### Break

If an unlabelled break, or a break with the switch's label is encountered,
then the execution will jump out of the switch and proceed directly after the end of the switch body.

#### Unreachable code

If a switch is exhaustive and all case clauses end with a jump instruction, containing no break statement out
of the current switch, then the code directly following the switch will be considered **unreachable**.

#### Switching over typeid

If the switch cond expression is a typeid, then case declarations may use only the type name after the case,
which will be interpreted as having an implicit `.typeid`. Example: `case int:` will be interpreted as if
written `case int.typeid`.

#### Nextcase without expression

Without a value `nextcase` will jump to the beginning of the next case clause. It is not allowed to
put `nextcase` without an expression if there are no following case clauses.

#### Nextcase with expression

Nextcase with an expression will evaluate the expression and then jump *as if* the switch was entered with
the cond expression corresponding to the value of the nextcase expression. Nextcase with an expression cannot
be used on a switch without a cond expression.

#### Do statement

The do statement first evaluates its body (inner statement), then evaluates the cond expression.
If the cond expression evaluates to true, jumps back into the body and repeats the process.

```
do_stmt            ::= "do" label? compound_stmt ("while" "(" cond_expr ")")? ";" 
```

#### Unreachable code

The statement after a `do` is considered unreachable if the cond expression cannot ever be false
and there is no `break` out of the do.

#### Break

`break` will exit the do with execution continuing on the following statement.

#### Continue

`continue` will jump directly to the evaluation of the cond, as if the end of the statement had been reached.

#### Do block

If no `while` part exists, it will only execute the block once, as if it ended with `while (false)`, this is
called a "do block"

### For statement

The `for` statement will perform the (optional) init expression. The cond expression will then be tested. If
it evaluates to `true` then the body will execute, followed by the incr expression. After execution will
jump back to the cond expression and execution will repeat until the cond expression evaluates to `false`.

```
for_stmt           ::= "for" label? "(" init_expr ";" cond_expr? ";" incr_expr ")" stmt
init_expr          ::= decl_expr_list?
incr_expr          ::= expr_list? 
```

#### Init expression

The init expression is only executed once before the rest of the for loop is executed.
Any declarations in the init expression will be in scope until the for loop exits.

The init expression may optionally be omitted.

#### Incr expression

The incr expression is evaluated before evaluating the cond expr every time except for the first one.

The incr expression may optionally be omitted.

#### Cond expression

The cond expression is evaluated every loop. Any declaration in the cond expression is scoped to the
current loop, i.e. it will be reinitialized at the start of every loop.

The cond expression may optionally be omitted. This is equivalent to setting the cond expression to
always return `true`.

#### Unreachable code

The statement after a `for` is considered unreachable if the cond expression cannot ever be false, or is
omitted and there is no `break` out of the loop.

#### Break

`break` will exit the `for` with execution continuing on the following statement after the `for`.

#### Continue

`continue` will jump directly to the evaluation of the cond, as if the end of the statement had been reached.

#### Equivalence of `while` and `for`

A `while` loop is functionally equivalent to a `for` loop without init and incr expressions.

### Foreach and foreach_r statements

The `foreach` statement will loop over a sequence of values. The `foreach_r` is equivalent to
`foreach` but the order of traversal is reversed.
`foreach` starts with element `0` and proceeds step by step to element `len - 1`.
`foreach_r` starts starts with element `len - 1` and proceeds step by step to element `0`.

```
foreach_stmt       ::= "foreach" label? "(" foreach_vars ":" expr ")" stmt
foreach_r_stmt     ::= "foreach_r" label? "(" foreach_vars ":" expr ")" stmt
foreach_vars       ::= (foreach_index ",")? foreach_var
foreach_var        ::= type? "&"? IDENTIFIER
```

#### Break

`break` will exit the foreach statement with execution continuing on the following statement after.

#### Continue

`continue` will cause the next iteration to commence, as if the end of the statement had been reached.

#### Iteration by value or reference

Normally iteration are by value. Each element is copied into the foreach variable. If `&`
is added before the variable name, the elements will be retrieved by reference instead, and consequently
the type of the variable will be a pointer to the element type instead.

#### Foreach variable

The foreach variable may omit the type. In this case the type is inferred. If the type differs from the element
type, then an implicit conversion will be attempted. Failing this is a compile time error.

#### Foreach index

If a variable name is added before the foreach variable, then this variable will receive the index of the element.
For `foreach_r` this mean that the first value of the index will be `len - 1`.

The index type defaults to `usz`.

If an optional type is added to the index, the index will be converted to this type. The type must be an
integer type. The conversion happens as if the conversion was a direct cast. If the actual index value
would exceed the maximum representable value of the type, this does not affect the actual iteration, but
may cause the index value to take on an incorrect value due to the cast.

For example, if the optional index type is `char` and the actual index is `256`, then the index value would show `0`
as `(char)256` evaluates to zero.

Modifying the index variable will not affect the foreach iteration.

#### Foreach support

Foreach is natively supported for any slice, array, pointer to an array, vector and pointer to a vector.
These types support both iteration by value and reference.

In addition, a type with **operator overload** for `len` and `[]` will support iteration by value,
and a type with **operator overload** for `len` and `&[]` will support iteration by reference.

### Return statement

The return statement evaluates its expression (if present) and returns the result.

```
return_stmt        ::= "return" expr? ";"
```

#### Jumps in return statements

If the expression should in itself cause an implicit return, for example due to the rethrow operator `!`, then this
jump will happen before the return.

An example:

    return foo()!;
    // is equivalent to:
    int temp = foo()!;
    return temp;

#### Return from expression blocks

A `return` from an expression block only returns out of the expression block, it never returns from the
expression block's enclosing scope.

#### Empty returns

An empty return is equivalent to a return with a void type. Consequently constructs like `foo(); return;`
and `return (void)foo();`
are equivalent.

#### Unreachable code

Any statement directly following a return in the same scope are considered unreachable.

### While statement

The while statement evaluates the cond expression and executes the statement if it evaluates to true.
After this the cond expression is evaluated again and the process is repeated until cond expression returns false.

```
while_stmt         ::= "while" label? "(" cond_expr ")" stmt
```

#### Unreachable code

The statement after a while is considered unreachable if the cond expression cannot ever be false
and there is no `break` out of the while.

#### Break

`break` will exit the while with execution continuing on the following statement.

#### Continue

`continue` will jump directly to the evaluation of the cond, as if the end of the statement had been reached.

### Var statement

A var statement declares a variable with inferred type, or a compile time type variable. It can be used both
for runtime and compile time variables. The use for runtime variables is limited to macros.

```
var_stmt           ::= "var" IDENTIFIER | CT_IDENT | CT_TYPE_IDENT ("=" expr)? ";" 
```

#### Inferring type

In the case of a runtime variable, the type is inferred from the expression. Not providing an expression
is a compile time error. The expression must resolve to a runtime type.

For compile time variables, the expression is optional. The expression may resolve to a runtime or compile time type.

#### Scope

Runtime variables will follow the runtime scopes, identical to behaviour in a declaration statement. The compile
time variables will follow the compile time scopes which are delimited by scoping compile time
statements (`$if`, `$switch`,
`$foreach` and `$for`).

## Attributes

Attributes are modifiers attached to modules, variables, type declarations etc.

#### @deprecated

Takes an optional constant string. 
If the node is in use, print the deprecation and add the optional string if present.

#### @optional

Marks an *interface* method as optional, and so does not need to be implemented by
a conforming type.

#### @winmain

Marks a `main` function as a win32 winmain function, which is the entrypoint for a windowed 
application on Windows. This allows the main function to take a different set of 
arguments than usual.

#### @callconv

`@callconv` can be used with a function or a call. It takes a constant string which is either "veccall", "stdcall" or "cdecl". If more than one `@callconv` 
is applied to a function or call, the last one takes precedence.

### User defined attributes

User defined attributes group a list of attributes.

```
attribute_decl     ::= "def" AT_TYPE_IDENT ("(" parameters ")")? attribute* "=" "{" attribute* "}" ";" 
```

#### Empty list of attributes

The list of attributes may be empty.

#### Parameter arguments

Arguments given to user defined attributes will be passed on to the attributes in the list.

#### Expansion

When a user defined attribute is encountered, its list of attributes is
copied and appended instead of the user defined attribute. Any argument passed to 
the attribute is evaluated and passed as a constant by the name of the parameter
to the evaluation of the attribute parameters in the list.

#### Nesting

A user defined attribute can contain other user defined attributes. The definition
may not be cyclic.

## Methods

#### Operator overloading

`@operator` overloads may only be added to user defined types (distinct, unions, struct, enum and fault).

##### Indexing operator ([])

This requires a return type and a method parameter, which is the index.

##### Reference indexing operator (&[])

This requires a return type and a method parameter, which is the index. If `[]` is implemented,
it should return a pointer to `[]`.

##### Assigning index operator (=[])

This has a void return type, and index should match that of `[]` and `&[]`. Value should match that 
of `[]` and be the pointee of the result of `&[]`.

##### Len operator (len)

This must have an integer return type.

#### Dynamic methods

`@dynamic` may be used on methods for any type except `any` and interfaces.


## Modules

Module paths are hierarchal, with each sub-path appended with '::' + the name:

```
path               ::= PATH_SEGMENT ("::" PATH_SEGMENT)
```

Each module declaration starts its own **module section**. All imports and all `@local` declarations
are only visible in the current **module section**.

```
module_section     ::= "module" path opt_generic_params? attributes? ";"
generic_param      ::= TYPE_IDENT | CONST_IDENT
opt_generic_params ::= "(<" generic_param ("," generic_param)* ">)"
```

Any visibility attribute defined in a **module section** will be the default visibility in all
declarations in the section.

If the `@benchmark` attribute is applied to the **module section** then all function declarations
will implicitly have the `@benchmark` attribute.

If the `@test` attribute is applied to the **module section** then all function declarations
will implicitly have the `@test` attribute.
