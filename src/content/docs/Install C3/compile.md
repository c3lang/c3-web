C3 has precompiled binaries for Windows, MacOS and Ubuntu. 
For other platforms it should be possible to compile it on any platform LLVM can compile to. You will need CMake installed.

## 1. Install LLVM

See LLVM the [LLVM documentation](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html) on how to set up LLVM for development. On MacOS, installing through Homebrew works fine.
Using apt-get on Linux should work fine as well. For Windows you can download suitable pre-compiled LLVM binaries
from https://github.com/c3lang/win-llvm

## 2. Clone the C3 compiler source code from Github

This should be as simple as doing:

```
git clone https://github.com/c3lang/c3c.git
```

... from the command line.

## 3. Build the compiler

Create the build directory:

```
MyMachine:c3c$ mkdir build
MyMachine:c3c$ cd build/
```

Use CMake to set up:

```
MyMachine:c3c/build$ cmake ../
```

Build the compiler:

```
MyMachine:c3c/build$ make
```

## 4. Test it out

```
MyMachine:c3c/build$ ./c3c compile-run ../resources/testfragments/helloworld.c3
```

# Building via Docker

You can build `c3c` using either an Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 container:

```
./build-with-docker.sh 18
```

Replace `18` with `20` to build through Ubuntu 20.04.

For a release build specify:
```
./build-with-docker.sh 20 Release
```

A `c3c` executable will be found under `bin/`.

# Building on OS X using Homebrew

2. Install CMake: `brew install cmake`
3. Install LLVM 17+: `brew install llvm`
4. Clone the C3C github repository: `git clone https://github.com/c3lang/c3c.git`
5. Enter the C3C directory `cd c3c`.
6. Create a build directory `mkdir build`
7. Change directory to the build directory `cd build`
8. Set up CMake build for debug: `cmake ..`
9. Build: `cmake --build .`
