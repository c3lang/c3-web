## C3 Programming Language

C3 is an evolution of C and a minimalist systems programming language.

### ðŸ¦º Ergonomics **and** Safety
- Optionals to safely and quickly handle errors and null.
- Defer to clean up resources.
- Slices and foreach for safe iteration.
- Contracts in comments, to add constraints to your code. 

### âš¡ Performance **by** default
- Write SIMD vectors to program the hardware directly.
- Access to different memory allocators to fine tune performance.
- Zero overhead errors.
- Fast compilation times.
- LLVM backend for industrial strength optimisations.
- Easy to use inline assembly.

### ðŸ”‹Batteries **included** standard library
- Dynamic containers and strings.
- Cross-platform abstractions for ease of use.
- Access to the native platform when you need it.

### ðŸ”§ Leverage **existing** C or C++ libraries
- Full C ABI compatibility.
- C3 can link C code, C can link C3 code.

### ðŸ“¦ Modules **are** simple
- Modules namespace code.
- Modules make encapsulation simple with explicit control.
- Interfaces define shared behaviour to write robust libraries.
- Generic modules make extending code easier.
- Simple struct composition and reuse with struct subtyping.

### ðŸŽ“ Macros **without** a PhD
- Macros can be similar to normal functions.
- Or write code that understands the types in your code.
