## Conversion Rules For C3
C3 differs in some crucial respects when it comes to number conversions and promotions. These are the rules for C3:

- `float` to `int` conversions require a cast.
- `int` to `float` conversions *do not* require a cast.
- `bool` to `float` converts to `0.0` or `1.0`
- Widening `float` conversions are only conditionally allowed<sup>*</sup>.
- Narrowing conversions require a cast<sup>*</sup>.
- Widening `int` conversions are only conditionally allowed<sup>*</sup>.
- Signed <-> unsigned conversions of the same type *do not* require a cast.
- In conditionals `float` to `bool` *do not* require a cast, any non zero `float` value considered true.
- Implicit conversion to `bool` only occurs in conditionals or when the value is enclosed in `()` e.g. `bool x = (1.0)` or `if (1.0) { ... }`

C3 uses two's complement arithmetic for all integer math.

These abbreviations are used in the text below:
- "lhs" meaning "left hand side".
- "rhs" meaning "right hand side".

### Target type

The left hand side of an assignment, or the parameter type in a call is known as the *target type* the target type is used for implicit widening and inferring struct initialization.

### Common arithmetic promotion

Like C, C3 uses implicit arithmetic promotion of integer and floating point variables before arithmetic operations:

1. For any floating point type with a bitwidth smaller than 32 bits, widen to `float`. E.g. `f16 -> float`
2. For an integer type smaller than the *minimum arithmetic width* promote the value to a same signed integer of the *minimum arithmetic width* (this usually corresponds to a c int/uint). E.g. `ushort -> uint`

### Implicit narrowing

An expression with an integer type, may implicitly narrow to smaller integer type, and similarly a float type may implicitly narrow to less wide floating point type is determined from the following algorithm.

1. Shifts and assign look at the lhs expression.
2. `++`, `--`, `~`, `-`, `!!`, `!` - check the inner type.
3. `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`, `|`, `&`, `??`, `?:` - check both lhs and rhs.
4. Narrowing `int`/`float` cast, assume the type is the narrowed type.
5. Widening `int`/`float` cast, look at the inner expression, ignoring the cast.
6. In the case of any other cast, assume it is opaque and the type is that of the cast.
7. In the case of an integer literal, instead of looking at the type, check that the integer would fit the type to narrow to.
8. For `.len` access, allow narrowing to C int width.
9. For all other expressions, check against the size of the type.

As rough guide: if all the sub expressions originally are small enough it's ok to implicitly convert the result.

Examples:
```c3
float16 h = 12.0;
float f = 13.0;
double d = 22.0;

char x = 1;
short y = -3;
int z = 0xFFFFF;
ulong w = -0xFFFFFFF;

x = x + x; // => calculated as x = (char)((int)x + (int)x);
x = y + x; // => Error, narrowing not allowed as y > char
h = x * h; // => calculated as h = (float16)((float)x * (float)h);
h = f + x; // => Error, narrowing not allowed since f > f16
```

### Implicit widening

Unlike C, implicit widening will only happen on "simple expressions":
if the expression is a primary expression, or a unary operation on a primary expression.

For assignment, special rules hold. For an assignment to a binary expression, *if* its two subexpressions are "simple expressions" and the binary expression is `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, allow an implicit promotion of the two sub expressions.

```c3
int a = ...
short b = ...
char c = ...
long d = a; // Valid - simple expression.
int e = (int)(d + (a + b)); // Error
int f = (int)(d + ~b); // Valid
long g = a + b; // Valid
```

As a rule of thumb, if there are more than one possible conversion an explicit cast is needed.

Example:

```c3
long h = a + (b + c);

// Possible intention 1
long h = (long)(a + (b + c));

// Possible intention 2
long h = (long)a + (long)(b + c);

// Possible intention 3
long h = (long)a + ((long)b + (long)c);
```

### Maximum type

The *maximum type* is a concept used when unifying two or more types. The algorithm follows:

1. First perform implicit promotion.
2. If both types are the same, the maximum type is this type. 
3. If one type is a floating point type, and the other is an integer type, 
the maximum type is the floating point type. E.g. `int + float -> float`.
4. If both types are floating point types, the maximum type is the widest floating point type. E.g. `float + double -> double`.
5. If both types are integer types with the same signedness, the 
maximum type is the widest integer type of the two. E.g. `uint + ulong -> ulong`.
6. If both types are integer types with different signedness, the 
maximum type is a signed integer with the same bit width as the maximum integer type. `ulong + int -> long`
7. If at least one side is a struct or a pointer to a struct with an 
`inline` directive on a member, check recursively check if the type of 
the inline member can be used to find a maximum type (see below under sub struct conversions)
8. All other cases are errors.
 
### Substruct conversions

Substructs may be used in place of its parent structs in many cases. The rule is as follows:

1. A substruct pointer may implicitly convert to a parent struct.
2. A substruct *value* may be implicitly assigned to a variable with the parent struct type, 
This will *truncate* the value, copying only the parent part of the substruct. However, a 
substruct value cannot be assigned its parent struct.
3. Substruct slices and arrays *can not* be cast (implicitly or explicitly) to an array of the parent struct type.

### Pointer conversions

Pointer conversion between types usually need explicit casts. 
The exception is `void*` which any type may implicitly convert *to* or *from*. 
Conversion rules from and to arrays are detailed under [arrays](/language-common/arrays/)

### Vector conversions

Conversion between underlying vector types need explicit conversions. They work
as regular conversions with one notable exception: converting a `true` boolean
vector value into an int will yield a value with all bits set. So `bool[<2>] { true, false }`
converted to for example `char[<2>]` will yield `{ 255, 0 }`.

Vectors can also be cast to the corresponding array type, for example: `char[<2>]` <=> `char[2]`.

## Binary conversions

These operations are only valid for integer and float types.

1. Resolve the operands.
2. Find the [maximum type](#maximum-type) of the two operands.

## Unary conversions

#### 1. Bit negate

1. Resolve the inner operand.
2. If the type inner type is not a number this is an error.
3. If the inner type is an unsigned integer, cast it to the same signed type.
4. The type is the type of the result from (3)

#### 5. `*`

1. Resolve the inner operand.
2. If the operand is not a pointer, or is a `void* ` pointer, this is an error.
3. The type is the pointee of the inner operand's type.

Dereferencing 0 is implementation defined.

#### 6. `++` and `--`

1. Resolve the inner operand.
2. If the type is not a number, this is an error.
3. The type is the same as the inner operand.

## Base expressions

#### 1. Typed identifiers

1. The type is that of the declaration.
2. If the width of the type is less than that of the target type, widen to the target type.
3. If the width of the type is greater than that of the target type, it is an error.

#### 2. Constants and literals

1. If the constant is an integer, it is assumed to be the *arithmetic promotion width* and signed. 
If the suffix `u` is added, it is assumed to be an unsigned number. If a suffix `ixx` or `uxx` 
is given then it is considered a an integer of that type width and signedness. It cannot be implicitly narrowed. 
2. If the constant is a floating point value, it is assumed to be a `double` unless suffixed
 with `f` which is then assumed to be a `float`. If a bit width is given after `f`, 
 it is instead a floating point type of that width.
