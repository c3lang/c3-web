By default, an executable is assumed, but changing the type to `"static-lib"` or `"dynamic-lib"` 
creates static library and dynamic library targets respectively.

*This part will be updated, stay tuned* 

## Compilation options

The project file contains common settings at the top level, that can be overridden by each
target, by simply assigning that particular key. So if the top level defines `target` to be `macos-x64`
and the actual target defines it to be `windows-x64`, then the `windows-x64` will be used for compilation.

Similarly, compiler command line parameters can be used in turn to override the target setting.

#### `targets`

The list of targets that can be built.

#### `dependencies`

List of C3 libraries (".c3l") to use when compiling the target.

#### `sources`

List of source files to compile and for tests which will run.

#### `cc`

C compiler to use for compiling C sources (if C sources are compiled together with C3 files).

#### `c-sources`

List of C sources to compile, using the default C compiler.

#### `linker-search-paths`

This adds paths for the linker to search, when linking normal C libraries.

#### `linked-libraries`

This is a list of C libraries to link to. The names need to follow the normal
naming standard for how libraries are provided to the system linker,
so for example on Linux, libraries have names like `libfoo.a` but when
presented to the linker the name is `foo`. As an example `"linked-libraries": ["curl"]`
would on Linux look for the library `libcurl.a` and `libcurl.so` in the 
paths given by "linker-search-paths".

#### `version`

*Not handled yet*

Version for library, will also be provided as a compile time constant.

#### `authors`

*Not handled yet*

List of authors to add for library compilation.

#### `langrev`

*Not handled yet*

The language revision to use. 

#### `features`

This is a list of upper-case constants that can be tested for
in the source code using `$feature(NAME_OF_FEATURE)`.

#### `warnings`

*Not completely supported yet*

List of warnings to enable during compilation.

#### `opt`

Optimization setting: O0, O1, O2, O3, O4, O5, Os, Oz.

## Target options

#### `type`

This mandatory option should be one of "executable", "dynamic-lib" and "static-lib".

*More types will be added*

## Using environment variables

*Not supported yet*

In addition to constants any values starting with "$" will be assumed to be environment variables.

For example `"$HOME"` would on unix systems return the home directory. For strings that start with $ but *should not* be interpreted as an environment variable. For example, the string `"\$HOME"` would be interpreted as the plain string `"$HOME"`.
