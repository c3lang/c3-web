You can use one of the precompiled binaries or [build the compiler from source](/references/getting-started/setup).

# Prebuilt binaries
- Windows x64 [download](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/download/latest/c3-windows.zip), [install instructions](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c#installing-on-windows-with-precompiled-binaries).
- Debian x64 [download](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/download/latest/c3-linux.tar.gz), [install instructions](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c#installing-on-debian-with-precompiled-binaries).
- MacOS x64 [download](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/download/latest/c3-macos.zip), [install instructions](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c#installing-on-mac-with-precompiled-binaries).

## Installing on Windows
1.  Download the zip file: [stable](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/download/latest/c3-windows.zip) [debug](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/download/latest/c3-windows-debug.zip)
2. Unzip it into a folder
3.  If you don't have Visual Studio 17 installed you can either install it or follow the next two steps.

4. Run the `msvc_build_libraries.py` Python script which will download the necessary files to compile on Windows.

:::note[Running the Python script]

If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [the Python Website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
or get it from the [the Microsoft Store](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/python-39/9p7qfqmjrfp7)

afterwards you can double click the python file and pick "python" from the list.

## Installing on Debian
1. Download tar file: [https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/download/latest/c3-linux.tar.gz](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/download/latest/c3-linux.tar.gz)
   (debug version [here](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/download/latest/c3-linux-debug.tar.gz))
2. Unpack executable and standard lib.
3. Run `./c3c`.

## Installing on Mac
1. Make sure you have XCode with command line tools installed.
2. Download the zip file: [https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/download/latest/c3-macos.zip](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/download/latest/c3-macos.zip)
   (debug version [here](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/releases/download/latest/c3-macos-debug.zip))
3. Unzip executable and standard lib.
4. Run `./c3c`.

## Installing on Arch Linux
There is an AUR package for the c3c compiler : [c3c-git](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/c3c-git).

Due to some issues with the LLVM packaged for Arch Linux, the AUR package will download and use LLVM 16 for Ubuntu-23.04 to compile the c3c compiler.

You can use your AUR package manager:
```bash
paru -S c3c-git
# or yay -S c3c-git
# or aura -A c3c-git
```

Or clone it manually:
```bash
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/c3c-git.git
cd c3c-git
makepkg -si
```
