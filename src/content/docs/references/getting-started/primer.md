This primer is intended as a guide to how the C syntax – and in some cases C semantics
– is different in C3. It is intended to help you take a piece of C code and understand
how it can be converted manually to C3.

#### Struct, enum and union declarations

Don't add a `;` after enum, struct and union declarations, and note the slightly
different syntax for declaring a named struct inside of a struct.

    // C
    typedef struct
    {
      int a;
      struct
      {
        double x;
      } bar;
    } Foo;

    // C3
    struct Foo
    {
      int a;
      struct bar
      {
        double x;
      }
    }

Also, user defined types are used without a `struct`, `union` or `enum` keyword, as
if the name was a C typedef.

#### Arrays

Array sizes are written next to the type and arrays do not decay to pointers,
you need to do it manually:

    // C
    int x[2] = { 1, 2 };
    int *y = x;

    // C3
    int[2] x = { 1, 2 };
    int* y = &x;

You will probably prefer slices to pointers when passing data around:

    // C
    int x[100] = ...;
    int y[30] = ...;
    int z[15] = ...;
    sort_my_array(x, 100);
    sort_my_array(y, 30);
    // Sort part of the array!
    sort_my_array(z + 1, 10);

    // C3
    int[100] x = ...;
    int[30] y = ...;
    sort_my_array(&x); // Implicit conversion from int[100]* -> int[]
    sort_my_array(&y); // Implicit conversion from int[30]* -> int[]
    sort_my_array(z[1..10]); // Inclusive ranges!

Note that declaring an array of inferred size will look different in C3:

    // C
    int x[] = { 1, 2, 3 }; // x is int[3]

    // C3
    int[*] x = { 1, 2, 3 }; // x is int[3]

Arrays are trivially copyable:

    // C
    int x[3] = ...;
    int y[3];
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) y[i] = x[i];

    // C3
    int[3] x = ...;
    int[3] y = x;

See more [here](/references/docs/arrays).

#### Undefined behaviour

C3 has less undefined behaviour, in particular integers are defined as using 2s
complement and signed overflow is wrapping. See more [here](/references/docs/undefinedbehaviour).

#### Functions

Functions are declared like C, but you need to put `fn` in front:

    // C:
    int foo(Foo *b, int x, void *z) { ... }

    // C3
    fn int foo(Foo* b, int x, void* z) { ... }

See more about functions, like named and default arguments [here](/references/docs/functions).

#### Calling C functions

Declare a function (or variable) with `extern` and it will be possible to
access it from C3:

    // To access puts:
    extern fn int puts(char*);
    ...
    puts("Hello world");

Note that currently only the C standard library is automatically passed to the linker.
In order to link with other libraries, you need to explicitly tell
the compiler to link them.

If you want to use a different identifier inside of your C3 code compared to
the function or variable's external name, use the `@extern` attribute:

    extern fn int _puts(char* message) @extern("puts");
    ...
    _puts("Hello world"); // <- calls the puts function in libc

#### Identifiers

Name standards are enforced:

    // Starting with uppercase and followed somewhere by at least
    // one lower case is a user defined type:
    Foo x;
    M____y y;

    // Starting with lowercase is a variable or a function or a member name:

    x.myval = 1;
    int z = 123;
    fn void fooBar(int x) { ... }

    // Only upper case is a constant or an enum value:

    const int FOOBAR = 123;
    enum Test
    {
      STATE_A,
      STATE_B
    }

#### Variable declaration

Multiple declarations together with initialization isn't allowed in C3:

    // C
    int a, b = 4; // Not allowed in C3

    // C3
    int a;
    int b = 4;

In C3, variables are always zero initialized, unless you explicitly opt out using `@noinit`:

    // C
    int a = 0;
    int b;

    // C3
    int a;
    int b @noinit;

#### Compound literals

Compound literals use C++ style brace initialization, not cast style like in C.
For convenience, assigning to a struct will infer the type even if it's not an initializer.

    // C
    Foo f = { 1, 2 };
    f = (Foo) { 1, 2 };
    callFoo((Foo) { 2, 3 });

    // C3
    Foo f = { 1, 2 };
    f = { 1, 2 };
    callFoo(Foo{ 2, 3 });


#### typedef and #define becomes 'def'

`typedef` is replaced by `def`:

    // C
    typedef Foo* FooPtr;

    // C3
    def FooPtr = Foo*;

`def` also allows you to do things that C uses `#define` for:

    // C
    #define println puts
    #define my_excellent_string my_string

    char *my_string = "Party on";
    ...
    println(my_excellent_string);

    // C3
    def println = puts;
    def my_excellent_string = my_string;

    char* my_string = "Party on";
    ...
    println(my_excellent_string);

Read more about `def` [here](/references/docs/define).

#### Basic types

Several C types that would be variable sized are fixed size, and others changed names:

    // C
    int16_t a;
    int32_t b;
    int64_t c;
    uint64_t d;
    size_t e;
    ssize_t f;
    ptrdiff_t g;
    intptr_t h;

    // C3
    short a;    // Guaranteed 16 bits
    int b;      // Guaranteed 32 bits
    long c;     // Guaranteed 64 bits
    ulong d;    // Guaranteed 64 bits
    int128 e;   // Guaranteed 128 bits
    uint128 f;  // Guaranteed 128 bits
    usz g;      // Same as C size_t, depends on target
    isz h;      // Same as C ptrdiff_t
    iptr i;     // Same as intptr_t depends on target
    uptr j;     // Same as uintptr_t depends on target

Read more about types [here](/references/docs/types).

#### Instead of #include: Modules and import

Declaring the module name is not mandatory, but if you leave it out the file name will be used
as the module name. Imports are recursive.

    module otherlib::foo;

    fn void test() { ... }
    struct FooStruct { ... }

    module mylib::bar;
    import otherlib;
    fn void myCheck()
    {
      foo::test(); // foo prefix is mandatory.
      mylib::foo::test(); // This also works;
      FooStruct x; // But user defined types don't need the prefix.
      otherlib::foo::FooStruct y; // But it is allowed.
    }


#### Comments

The `/* */` comments are nesting

```text
/* This /* will all */ be commented out */
```

Note that doc comments, starting with `/**` has special rules for parsing it, and is
not considered a regular comment. See [contracts](/references/docs/contracts) for more information.

#### Type qualifiers

Qualifiers like `const` and `volatile` are removed, but `const` before a constant
will make it treated as a compile time constant. The constant does not need to be typed.

    const A = false;
    // Compile time
    $if A:
      // This will not be compiled
    $else
      // This will be compiled
    $endif

`volatile` is replaced by macros for volatile load and store.

#### Goto removed

`goto` is removed, but there is labelled `break` and `continue` as well as `defer`
to handle the cases when it is commonly used in C.

    // C
    Foo *foo = malloc(sizeof(Foo));

    if (tryFoo(foo)) goto FAIL;
    if (modifyFoo(foo)) goto FAIL;

    free(foo);
    return true;

    FAIL:
    free(foo);
    return false;

    // C3, direct translation:
    do FAIL:
    {
        Foo *foo = malloc(sizeof(Foo));

        if (tryFoo(foo)) break FAIL;
        if (modifyFoo(foo)) break FAIL;

        free(foo);
        return true;
    }
    free(foo);
    return false;

    // C3, using defer:
    Foo *foo = malloc(Foo);
    defer free(foo);

    if (tryFoo(foo)) return false;
    if (modifyFoo(foo)) return false;

    return true;


#### Changes in `switch`

`case` statements automatically break. Use `nextcase` to fallthrough to the
next statement, but empty case statements have implicit fallthrough:

    // C
    switch (a)
    {
      case 1:
      case 2:
        doOne();
        break;
      case 3:
        i = 0;
      case 4:
        doFour();
        break;
      case 5:
        doFive();
      default:
        return false;
    }

    // C3
    switch (a)
    {
      case 1:
      case 2:
        doOne();
      case 3:
        i = 0;
        nextcase;
      case 4:
        doFour();
      case 5:
        doFive();
        nextcase;
      default:
        return false;
    }

Note that we can jump to an arbitrary case using C3:

    // C
    switch (a)
    {
      case 1:
        doOne();
        goto LABEL3;
      case 2:
        doTwo();
        break;
      case 3:
    LABEL3:
        doThree();
      default:
        return false;
    }

    // C3
    switch (a)
    {
      case 1:
        doOne();
        nextcase 3;
      case 2:
        doTwo();
      case 3:
        doThree();
        nextcase;
      default:
        return false;
    }

#### Bitfields are replaced by explicit bitstructs

A bitstruct has an explicit container type, and each field has an exact bit range.

```c
bitstruct Foo : short
{
    int a : 0..2; // Exact bit ranges, bits 0-2
    uint b : 3..6;
    MyEnum c : 7..13;
}
```

There exists a simplified form for a bitstruct containing only booleans,
it is the same except the ranges are left out:

```c
struct Flags : char
{
    bool has_hyperdrive;
    bool has_tractorbeam;
    bool has_plasmatorpedoes;
}
```
