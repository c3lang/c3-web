## Contributing
The C3 language is still in its *design phase*, which means functionality and specification are
subject to change. That also means that any contribution right now will have a big impact on the language.
So if you find the project interesting, here's what you can do to help:


- Discuss the language on the C3 Discord [https://discord.gg/qN76R87](https://discord.gg/qN76R87) 
- Suggest improvements by filing an issue: [https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/issues/new](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c/issues/new)
- Spotted a typo or found a broken link? [https://github.com/c3lang/c3-web/issues/new](https://github.com/c3lang/c3-web/issues/new)
- Offer to work on the compiler being written here: [https://github.com/c3lang/c3c](https://github.com/c3lang/c3c)
