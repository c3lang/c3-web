Let's start with a simple "Hello World" program. The simplest Hello World you can write in C3 looks like this:

```c3
import std::io;

fn void main()
{
    io::printn("Hello, World!");
}
```

The `import` statement imports other modules, and we want `printn` which
is in `std::io`

:::note

Import is always recursive, so `import std::io` actually
imports both `std::io` and its sub-modules, such as `std::io::path` (which 
handles file paths). You could even do `import std;`, which would import the entire standard library into your project!
:::


Next we define a function, which starts with the `fn` keyword followed by the return type. In this case we don't need to return anything, so we use `void`. Then follows the name of the function, `main`, followed by the parameter list, which is empty.
```cpp
fn void main() {}
```

:::tip
the name `main` is a bit special as it is also the entry point to the program.

For Unix-like OSes there are a few different variants, for example we might declare it as `fn void main(String[] args)`. In that case the parameter "args" contains a *slice* of strings, which correspond to the command line arguments, with the first one being the name of the application itself.
:::


`{` and `}` signifies the start and end of the function respectively. Inside we have a single
call to the function `printn` in `std::io`. We use the last part of the path "io" in front of
the function to identify what module it belongs to.

:::tip
We could also have used `std::io::printn`
if we wanted. Just a part of the module path, like "io::printn", is known as "path-shortening" and is the common way of referring to functions (avoid `std::io::printn`, it's not idiomatic).

```diff lang="cpp"
- std::io::printn("Hello, World!");
+ io::printn("Hello, World!");

```
:::

The `io::printn` function takes a single argument and prints it, followed by a line feed After this the function ends and the program terminates.

```cpp  ins="Hello, World!"
fn void main()
{
    io::printn("Hello, World!");
}

```


### Compiling the program

Let's take the above program and put it in a file called `hello_world.c3`.

We can then compile it:

```bash 
$ c3c compile hello_world.c3
```

And run it:

```bash
$ ./hello_world
```

It should print `Hello, World!` and return back to the command line prompt. 
If you are on Windows, you will have `hello_world.exe` instead. Call it in the same way.

### Compiling and running

When we start out it can be useful to compile and then have the compiler start the
program immediately. We can do that with `compile-run`:

```bash {4}
$ c3c compile-run hello_world.c3
> Program linked to executable 'hello_world'.
> Launching hello_world...
> Hello, World
```

If you followed along so far: Congratulations! You're now up and running with C3.
