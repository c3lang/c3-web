### 3 Contributions Welcome!


```c3
fn void test(int times)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < times; i++)
    {
        io::printfn("Hello %d", i);
    }
}
```

The C3 language is still in its *development* phase, which means
functionality and specification are subject to change. That also means
that any contribution right now will have a big impact on the language.
So if you find the project interesting, here’s what you can do to help:

### 💬 Discuss The Language

### 💪 Contribute

Now the compiler is stable, what is needed now are the *non-essentials*, such as a docs generator, editor plugins, LSP etc.
