# C3 0.7.4 – enum updates and more

C3 version 0.7.4 brings a substantial set of improvements focused on better enum support, enhanced error handling, improved debugging capabilities, and numerous quality-of-life improvements. Here's a comprehensive look at what's new.

## Major Language Features

### Enhanced Enum Support
One of the most significant changes in 0.7.4 is the introduction of **const enums**.
- **Const enums**: You can now declare `enum Foo : const`, which behaves like C enums but supports any underlying type
- **Direct enum casting**: Casting to and from regular enums is now possible again without needing `.ordinal` and `.from_ordinal` methods
- **Deprecation warning**: Inline associated enum values are now deprecated (use `--use-old-enums` to maintain compatibility)

### New Error Handling Macros
C3 0.7.4 introduces two useful new macros for streamlined error handling:
- **`@try`**: Takes an lvalue and returns a `void?`. It assigns the value if successful, otherwise returns the error.
- **`@try_catch`**: Extended version that takes an lvalue, an expression, and the expected error value, it will return a `bool?`.

These macros can significantly reduce boilerplate when working with `if-catch`.

### Compile-Time Improvements
Several compile-time features have been enhanced:
- **`$typeof` improvements**: Now returns compile-time types in more contexts
- **`@is_const` introduction**: This macro replaces the deprecated `$is_const`, and is based on `$defined`
- **Multiline contract comments**: Contract documentation can now span multiple lines

## Developer Experience Enhancements
### Better Error Messages and Debugging
C3 0.7.4 focuses heavily on improving the developer experience:
- **Improved error messages**: Better reporting for missing enum qualifiers, struct initialization errors, and unsigned-to-signed conversion issues
- **Common mistake detection**: The compiler now catches accidental `foo == BAR;` where `foo = BAR;` was likely intended
- **Enhanced debugging output**: Added `--echo-prefix` for customizing `$echo` statement prefixes with `{FILE}` and `{LINE}` support

### Assembly and Low-Level Development
- **`--list-asm` flag**: View all supported assembly instructions
- **Unaligned access detection**: The compiler now checks for unaligned array access
- **Thread synchronization**: New `thread::fence` function provides thread fencing capabilities

### Build System Improvements
- **Smarter output directories**: Projects now output to `out` by default, with temp folders used for command-line builds
- **Absolute path support**: `$embed` now accepts absolute paths
- **Math library auto-linking**: libc math functions are now only linked when math functions are used.

## Performance and Memory Management
### Hash Function Additions
The standard library now includes several new high-performance hash functions:
- komihash
- a5hash
- metrohash64 and metrohash128
- wyhash2 variants
- SipHash family of keyed PRFs

### Memory Management Improvements
- **Virtual memory**: New virtual memory library and arena allocator
- **Smaller memory limits**: Support for even more restrictive memory environments
- **Arena allocator fixes**: Resolved resize bugs in ArenaAllocator, DynamicArenaAllocator, and BackedArenaAllocator
- **No temp allocator in backtrace**: Removed temp allocator usage in backtrace printing.

## Standard Library Enhancements
### Cryptography and Security
- **Whirlpool hash**: Added the Whirlpool cryptographic hash function
- **Ed25519**: Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm support

### String and I/O Operations
- **`string::bformat`**: New binary formatting capabilities
- **Enhanced formatting**: The format option now supports pointers `%h`
- **String case conversion**: Functions for converting between snake_case and PascalCase

### Concurrency Improvements
- **Condition variable enhancements**: Added `ConditionVariable.wait_until` and `ConditionVariable.wait_for`
- **Stream I/O**: New `readline_to_stream` function for stream-based input

### Experimental Features
- **Reference counting**: `Ref` and `RefCounted` experimental types
- **Memory safety types**: `Volatile` and `UnalignedRef` generic types for typesafe volatile and unaligned references.

## Bug Fixes and Stability
Version 0.7.4 includes over 40 bug fixes addressing:
- Platform-specific issues (Android, Windows, POSIX)
- Compile-time constant evaluation
- Memory management edge cases
- Type system consistency
- Code generation improvements

Notable fixes include proper handling of null ZString comparisons, correct bounds checking for const ranges, and fixes to complex number operations.

## Deprecations and Migration
Several features have been deprecated and to streamline the language:
- `$is_const` → `@is_const`
- `$assignable` → `@assignable_to`
- `allocator::heap()` → `mem` and `allocator::temp()` → `tmem`
- Inline associated enum values (use `--use-old-enums` for compatibility)

## Diving deeper into the new const enums

C3 introduced ordinal based enums in 0.3.0. This allowed the language to support associated enum values and enum → string conversions at runtime with zero overhead. The downside was the lack of support for C enums with gaps. While possible to address with constants or associated values, it lacked the ease of C enums. However, C enums could not be made to properly support things the same things as the 0.3 C3 enums did.

The new "const enum" solves this problem. It works like a distinct type, with constants associated with it. It is defined like an enum, with `const` added after `:`. Its behaviour is the same as you would expect from C:

```c3
enum ConstEnum : const short
{
    ABC = 1,
    BDE,     // Implicitly 2
    DEF = 100
}
```

But the const enums can do things C enums can't do:

```c3
enum Greeting : const inline String
{
    HELLO = "Hello",
    WORLD = "World",
    YO    = "Yo"
}

fn void main()
{
    // Prints "Hello"
    io::printn(Greeting.HELLO); 
    // Inline allows implicit conversion to String
    io::printn(Greeting.YO == "Yo");
    // Inference works like for regular enums 
    Greeting g = WORLD; 
}
```

:::note[Note On reflection]
The cost we pay for this is that we cannot get the ordinal, nor the name, so neither `Greeting.YO.nameof` nor `Greeting.YO.ordinal` will work.
:::


## TLDR;

C3 0.7.4 introduces improved enum support, new error handling macros, and several enhancements to the developer experience. Key additions include const enums with flexible underlying types, direct enum casting, and streamlined error-handling via @try and @try_catch. The release also brings better error messages, improved debugging tools, and expanded standard library features such as new hash functions, Ed25519 support, and virtual memory management. Numerous bug fixes and deprecations aim to improve language consistency and performance. This version marks continued progress toward language maturity and usability.
